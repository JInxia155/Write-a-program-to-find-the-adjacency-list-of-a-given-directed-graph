 üîç QUESTIONS (Write a program to find the adjacency list of a given directed graph) QUESTIONS (Write a program to find the adjacency list of a given directed graph)


    Write a program to find the adjacency list of a given directed graph G which is represented as

adjacency matrix.

Input Format:

    The first line of the input contains a positive integer n, the number of vertices in the graph, in the range 1 to 1000.

    The next lines represents the Adjacency matrix representation of the given graph.

Output Format:

Then lines contain the adjacency list of each node in ascending order. Each line contains the label of the respective node followed by the nodes adjacent to it sorted in ascending order from left to right separated by single space. If a node has no adjacent nodes, then the line corresponding to its adjacency list will contain

the label of that node only.

    Second line contains an integer n –Ñ [1, 1000], that denotes the number of vertices in the graph.

    The subsequent n lines contain the label of the respective node followed by the nodes adjacent to it sorted in ascending order from left to right separated by single space.

    The subsequent n lines contain label of the respective node followed by the weights of the edges corresponding to the adjacency list separated by single space. The edge weights are real numbers in the range [-10000, 10000].

Further, no two edges have the same weight.

Input Format:

    The first line of the input contains a positive integer n = [1, 1000], the number of nodes in the graph.

    The subsequent n lines contain the label of the respective node followed by the nodes adjacent to it, sorted in ascending order from left to right separated by single space. If a node has no adjacent nodes, then the line corresponding to its adjacency list will contain the label of that node only.

    The subsequent n lines contain label of the respective node followed by the weights of the edges corresponding to the adjacency list separated by single space. The edge weights are positive real numbers in the range (0, 10000]. If a node has no adjacent nodes, then the line corresponding to its adjacent edge weights will contain the label of that node only.

    The rest of the input consists of multiple lines, each one containing a four‚Äìletter string followed by zero, one or two integers. The integers, if given, will be in the range 0 to n‚Äì1.

sorted in the order of their labels, in single space separated format. Print ‚ÄúINF‚Äú for

nodes that are

The string ‚Äússsp‚Äú is followed by two integers, respectively, labels of the source and des- tination nodes. Print the shortest path from the source node to the destination node, if such a path exists. Print ‚ÄúUNREACHABLE‚Äú, otherwise.

The string ‚Äústop‚Äú means terminate the program.

Output Format:

The output, if any, of each command should be printed on a separate line.
